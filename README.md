The project is mainly based on first two books by Peter Shirley which I highly recommend to read if you want to dive into ray tracing world. In addition, I have also improved the code a bit with simple multi-threading and direct image conversion (i.e to .png format) with ImageMagick.

# Dependencies
- Magick++ API (https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/tree/master/Magick%2B%2B)

# TODO
- Implement features from "Ray Tracing - The Rest of Your Life"
