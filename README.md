# Simple-Ray-Tracer-by-Shirley

The project is mainly based on first two books by Peter Shirley which I highly recommend to read if you want to dive into ray tracing world. In addition, I have also improved the code a bit with simple multi-threading and direct image conversion (i.e to .png format) with ImageMagick.
